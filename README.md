## What is this?

A super simple app to vote on where to eat. No more endless debates, just tap and decide.


## How it works
This app is designed to make group decisions easy and fun. Here’s how to use it in just a few steps:

### 🟢 1. **Create a new poll**
Open the app and click the “NEW POLL” button.
This will instantly generate a unique poll ID that identifies your session.

You’ll be taken to a new page where you (and others) can vote on your favorite places.

### ✅ 2. **Share the poll**
Copy the poll URL or just the poll ID and send it to your friends, colleagues, roommates, or whoever’s voting with you.

They’ll be able to access the voting page directly. No login or account needed.

### 📝 3. **Vote!**
Each voter can enter their name, choose one or more preferred locations from the list, and submit their vote.

Simple and fast, just a couple of clicks.

### 🏆 4. **View the results**
As votes come in, results are updated in real time.
You can see who voted, which places are most popular, and what the final ranking looks like.

Anyone with the link can check the results.
